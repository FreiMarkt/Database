The steps of deploying SQL scripts:

1) download SQL Server 2000 (Or any other version of Sql Server) on the virtual machine;

2) install Sql server 2000, and set the server by yourself;

3) run the server, and open the Sql Query analyzer;

4) paste the Sql scripts on the Sql Query analyzer, and deploy it;

5) then the database will be built, you can use "select * from Passivemember" to check if the database was built (because
I have insert one piece of data into the "passivemember" table of the databse).
